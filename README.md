# Personal Portfolio - OUTDATED

## New Personal Website can be found [here](christian-rhodes.com)

This portfolio site was my first website made with a JavaScript framework. Vue is very lightweight and boasts great load times. This was appealing to me since I wanted to display many graphics on one page, including gifs. Originally, this portfolio had many pages, but I decided on a more simple single page application, with some dynamic content being shown or hidden on toggle.

### Technologies:
- Vue.js
- Netlify for hosting
